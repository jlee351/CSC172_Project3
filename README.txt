// Explanation:

    destruction_example_1.txt, destruction_example_2.txt:
    given text input file; contains numbers (nodes) for the program

    class Node:
    Node class for StopContagion.java. Has String value, and a ArrayList of nodes. Includes setter and getter methods for each parameter.

    class Read:
    class that mainly handles parsing through the given input file.

    class StopContagion

    countDeg
    counts degree

    maxDeg
    returns maximum degree

    findNode
    finds node

    getNode
    returns node in array

    removeNode
    removes node

    removeNodeAll
    removes all nodes

    sumDegree
    returns sum of degrees

    inoculate
    "to inoculate a network is to detect those nodes, or graph vertices, that exert the maximum influence on the whole network."

    outputDegree
    prints countDeg

    Ball
    the set of nodes whose shortest path from node i does not exceed r.

    sigma
    δBall(i, r) is the set of nodes whose shortest path from node i is exactly r.

    colInfluence
    gets collective influence

    mostInfluence
    most influence node

    dismantle
    dismantles a network
